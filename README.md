# Coding-Interview-Prep
Must do stuff for all coding interviews will keep updating stuff occasionally


## How to use this? 
### Simply go to the individual topic files in TopicWiseQuestions folder - I have tried to include as much information as possible : 
1. The links needed to see that question
2. Minimalistic & Commented Code
3. Tried to order in terms of difficulty - You can choose to follow any order ofcourse. Given order is suggested.

## Best Practices
1. Code.code.code. - there is no way around this - if someone else is saying anything else they are lying or they don't know enough.
2. Try it yourself - see the question - if not getting it - see the approach - code it - still not getting? - see my code - but still write it your own way.
That is how you will learn no way around.

## Best Sites for Practice. Follow them in the given order exactly!
### DO NOT SKIP ANY QUESTION OR TOPIC - DON'T FOOL YOURSELF:
### Use the free offerings in the best way possible - DO ALL OF THEM :
